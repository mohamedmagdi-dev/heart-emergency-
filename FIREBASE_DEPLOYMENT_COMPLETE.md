## 🚀 **Local Storage Solution:**

### **How It Works:**
1. **Doctor uploads certificate** → Saved to device storage
2. **File path stored in Firestore** → Database reference only
3. **Admin views certificate** → Loaded from local storage
4. **No cloud storage costs** → Everything stays on device

### **File Storage Locations:**
```
📱 Device Storage:
├── 📁 certificates/
│   ├── doctor1_cert_123.pdf
│   └── doctor2_cert_456.jpg
├── 📁 id_documents/
│   ├── user1_id_789.jpg
│   └── user2_id_012.pdf
└── 📁 profile_pictures/
    ├── user1_profile.jpg
    └── user2_profile.png

☁️ Firestore Database:
└── users/doctor123/
    ├── certificates: ["/path/to/cert1.pdf", "/path/to/cert2.jpg"]
    ├── profileImage: "/path/to/profile.jpg"
    └── ... (other user data)
```
