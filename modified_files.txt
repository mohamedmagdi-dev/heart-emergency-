## Files to be Updated by User

### Android Configuration
- android/app/google-services.json (Download from Firebase Console)
- android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml (Already updated with permissions)
- android/app/build.gradle.kts (Already configured)
- android/build.gradle.kts (Already has Google services plugin)

### iOS Configuration (if deploying to iOS)
- ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist (Download from Firebase Console)
- ios/Runner/Info.plist (Add location and notification permissions)
- ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift (Add Google Maps API key)
- ios/Podfile (Set minimum iOS version to 13.0)

### Google Maps API
- android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
  Line 64: Replace "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY" with actual API key
- ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift
  Add: GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY")

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Firebase Authentication service
- Firestore database service
- Firebase Storage service
- FCM and notifications service
- All data models (User, Request, Review, Transaction, Notification)
- Main app Firebase initialization
- Android configuration files
- Comprehensive documentation
- Build instructions

### üìù To be Implemented by User (Screen Updates)
The following screens need to be updated to use Firebase services instead of local storage:

1. lib/features/auth/screens/
   - patient_auth_screen.dart (Use FirebaseAuthService)
   - doctor_auth_screen.dart (Use FirebaseAuthService)
   - enhanced_admin_login.dart (Use FirebaseAuthService)

2. lib/features/patient/screens/
   - enhanced_patient_dashboard.dart (Use Firestore streams)
   - emergency_request.dart (Use Firestore service)
   - patient_wallet.dart (Use Firestore wallet service)
   - enhanced_patient_payment.dart (Use transaction service)
   - enhanced_patient_appointment.dart (Use Firestore requests)

3. lib/features/doctor/screens/
   - enhanced_doctor_dashboard.dart (Use Firestore streams)
   - doctor_registration.dart (Use FirebaseStorage for certificates)

4. lib/features/admin/screens/
   - enhanced_admin_dashboard.dart (Use Firestore admin queries)

5. lib/features/wallet/screens/
   - wallet_screen.dart (Use Firestore wallet service)

### Implementation Pattern Example

Before (Local Storage):
```dart
final data = await LocalStorageService.instance.read('users', userId);
```

After (Firebase):
```dart
final authService = FirebaseAuthService();
final firestoreService = FirestoreService();

// For one-time read
final userData = await authService.getUserData(userId);

// For real-time updates
Stream<UserModel> userStream = firestoreService.getUserStream(userId);
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Created
1. test/utils/haversine_test.dart
   - Distance calculation tests

2. test/services/firestore_test.dart (to be created)
   - Firestore service unit tests

3. test/models/model_test.dart (to be created)
   - Model serialization tests

### Integration Tests Required
1. Authentication flow test
2. Emergency request creation test
3. Payment and wallet test
4. Doctor verification test
5. Notification delivery test

## Build Commands Summary

### Development
```bash
# Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Run on device
flutter run

# iOS CocoaPods (if deploying to iOS)
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Debug APK (for testing)
flutter build apk --debug

# Release APK (unsigned)
flutter build apk --release

# App Bundle (for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS (macOS only)
flutter build ios --release
```

## Security Checklist Before Production
